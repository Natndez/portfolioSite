### Nathan Fernandez Portfolio Site
#### Project Background:
Learning Web Development has been an integral part of my current position as a Web Developer at Andrews University Communications. Whilst I've been able to learn a lot of things developing for the University, I've been craving the opportunity to make something entirely on my own. Designing, building, and styling webpages is such a fun part of Web Development that I would like to have the chance to do it **my own** way. This site in particular is meant to be a chance to do that, while at the same time giving me a place to showcase some of my other work. I anticipate that I will be constantly updating this site as my skills as a web developer progress. Hopefully you, the reader of this, are able to join me for this fun adventure.
