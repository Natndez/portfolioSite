### Nathan Fernandez Portfolio Site
#### Project Background:
Learning Web Development has been an integral part of my current position as a Web Developer at Andrews University Communications. While I've been able to learn a lot of things developing for the University, I've been craving the opportunity to create a website that has no requirements other than the ones I set for myself. While in the workplace I am able to have a great time creating pages, I wanted to have an opportunity to make websites that are entirely based on **my vision**. This site is an opportunity to make my vision for a website into a reality, while at the same time giving me a hub to showcase some of my other work. Furthermore, while I am able to use frameworks like SolidJS to help me with the front-end, I wanted to create this site to look just as cutting edge, but without the crutch of a framework. I will be constantly updating this site as my skills as a web developer progress. Hopefully you, the reader of this, are able to join me for this adventure.
